                   <p>Each customer relationship is a unique partnership, and we treat it as such. We sit down and
                     develop a personalized plan - never ever using a cookie-cutter approach. We know that every 
                     client has different platforms, configurations, challenges, and needs, so we seek to understand
                     the environment before developing a solution. We start by understanding data movement and ongoing
                     maintenance and governance needs as well as current advanced analytical capabilities. We then 
                     develop a plan and proof of concept (POC) to ensure we provide the value and outcomes expected. 
                     Lastly, we assign associates—both on and offshore—to form a 24/7 team that supports any needs 
                     that arise. Throughout the process, a project management application automatically provides
                     updates and insight into the work being completed, which offers peace of mind and saves our 
                     customers time by only having status meetings when necessary.</p>
